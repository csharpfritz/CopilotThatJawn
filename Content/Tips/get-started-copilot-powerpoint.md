## Copilot Feature: Instantly Generate a Presentation

With Copilot, you can create a complete presentation from a simple prompt:

1. Click the **Copilot** icon in the ribbon.
2. In the Copilot panel, type a prompt like:
   > "Create a 5-slide presentation about the benefits of AI-powered productivity tools for the Tech Community."
3. Copilot will generate a well-structured, visually engaging presentation—ready for you to review and customize.

**Pro Tip:**

- You can ask Copilot to rewrite slide content, suggest images, or improve your design. Just select a slide, click Copilot, and describe what you want to enhance.
