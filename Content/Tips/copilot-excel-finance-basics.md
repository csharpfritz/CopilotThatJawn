As a finance professional, Excel is your essential toolkit. Let's start with the basics of how Copilot can transform your daily Excel tasks.

## Getting Started with Basic Prompts

### 1. Formatting Financial Data
```excel-prompt
"Format column B as currency with two decimal places and thousands separator"
"Add accounting format to range A2:D50 with negative numbers in red"
"Format dates in column C to show as MM/DD/YYYY"
```

### 2. Simple Calculations
```excel-prompt
"Sum the values in column B if the corresponding date in column A is this quarter"
"Calculate the percentage change between each row in column C"
"Find the average of the last 12 months of revenue"
```

### 3. Basic Data Cleaning
```excel-prompt
"Remove duplicate transactions from range A2:E100"
"Standardize company names in column B to match the master list in sheet 'References'"
"Convert all text in column D to proper case"
```

## Pro Tips for Basic Operations

### 1. Be Specific with Ranges
Instead of:
```excel-prompt
"Format the numbers"
```
Try:
```excel-prompt
"Format cells B2:B100 as currency with $ symbol and two decimal places"
```

### 2. Use Clear Data Context
Instead of:
```excel-prompt
"Calculate the total"
```
Try:
```excel-prompt
"Calculate the total revenue for each quarter, excluding cancelled orders in column E"
```

### 3. Chain Related Commands
```excel-prompt
"First sort the data by date in column A, then calculate monthly totals, and finally create a pivot table showing monthly trends"
```

## Common Basic Tasks with Examples

### Creating Simple Reports
```excel-prompt
"Create a summary table with total sales by region"
"Generate a monthly comparison showing this year vs last year"
"Build a basic dashboard showing top 5 customers by revenue"
```

### Data Validation
```excel-prompt
"Add data validation to column C to only allow dates between 1/1/2024 and today"
"Create a dropdown list in column B using the values in range 'References!A2:A20'"
"Flag any numbers in column D that are more than 2 standard deviations from the mean"
```

## Quick Reference: Helpful Prompts

### Formatting
- "Make headers bold and center-aligned with light gray background"
- "Apply comma format to numbers over 1000"
- "Add borders around the range A1:E50"

### Basic Analysis
- "Show me rows where revenue exceeds expenses"
- "Highlight cells with negative values in red"
- "Create a running total in column E"

### Simple Charts
- "Create a line chart showing trend of monthly sales"
- "Make a bar chart comparing regions"
- "Generate a pie chart of expenses by category"

## Best Practice Tips

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with basic formatting requests
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Test commands on small ranges first

2. **Be Clear and Specific**

   - Mention column headers by name
   - Include any special conditions

3. **Review and Refine**

## Next Steps
