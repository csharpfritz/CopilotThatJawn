# Using GitHub Copilot to Visualize Data

GitHub Copilot is a powerful ally when working with data visualization. Let's explore how it can help you create stunning visualizations with minimal effort, using real-world examples from AI development trends.

## AI Productivity Trends

First, let's look at how developer productivity has increased with AI tools:

![Developer Productivity Trend](images/productivity-trend.png "Developer productivity increase with AI tools from 2020 to 2025")

This visualization shows the dramatic increase in developer productivity scores from 2020 to 2025, highlighting the impact of AI-powered development tools.

## AI Tools Adoption

Next, let's examine the adoption rates of various AI tools in the development community:

![AI Tools Usage](images/tools-usage.png "Adoption rates of different AI tools in 2025")

The chart clearly shows GitHub Copilot leading the adoption rates among AI development tools, with significant uptake of other Copilot variants as well.

## Time Savings Analysis

Finally, let's break down where developers are saving time with AI tools:

The pie chart reveals that code generation represents the largest time savings, followed by documentation and testing tasks.

## Python Example: Creating These Visualizations

Here's a simple example of creating a bar chart with Python using Copilot:

Here's how we created these visualizations using Python with Copilot. Notice how Copilot helps structure the code and suggests appropriate styling:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Set style with Copilot's suggestion
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8')
sns.set_theme()
sns.set_palette("husl")

# Create a line plot for productivity trend
def create_productivity_chart():
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    years = np.array([2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025])
    scores = np.array([10, 15, 25, 45, 75, 100])
    
    plt.plot(years, scores, marker='o', linewidth=2, markersize=8)
    plt.title("Developer Productivity with AI Tools")
    plt.xlabel("Year")
    plt.ylabel("Productivity Score")
    plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
```

Copilot will help you with the correct syntax and best practices for data visualization. It can even suggest appropriate chart types based on your data structure!

## Interactive Web Visualizations

For web applications, Copilot can help you create interactive visualizations using Chart.js. Here's how you can create an interactive version of our AI tools adoption chart:

```javascript
const ctx = document.getElementById('aiToolsChart').getContext('2d');
new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
        labels: ['GitHub Copilot', 'Microsoft 365 Copilot', 'Copilot Studio', 'Azure Copilot'],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Adoption Rate (%)',
            data: [85, 65, 45, 40],
            backgroundColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.8)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.8)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.8)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.8)'
            ],
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        responsive: true,
        plugins: {
            title: {
                display: true,
                text: 'AI Tools Adoption Rate (2025)'
            }
        },
        scales: {
            y: {
                beginAtZero: true,
                max: 100
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Pro Tips for Data Visualization with Copilot

1. **Start with Comments**: Begin by commenting what you want to achieve. Copilot understands natural language descriptions like:
   ```python
   # Create a pie chart showing the distribution of time saved by AI tools
   # Include percentages and make the most important category pop out
   ```

2. **Iterate Quickly**: Use Copilot to try different visualization types and customize them.
3. **Use Modern Libraries**: Copilot excels at suggesting modern visualization libraries and their best practices.
4. **Responsive Design**: Let Copilot help you make your visualizations responsive and mobile-friendly.

Remember, Copilot can help with:

- Choosing appropriate chart types based on your data
- Setting up data structures and preprocessing
- Styling and customization options
- Handling interactivity and animations
- Implementing responsive designs and accessibility features

Try these examples and let Copilot help you create beautiful, insightful visualizations that tell your data's story effectively!
