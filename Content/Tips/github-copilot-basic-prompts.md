# Basic Prompt Engineering for GitHub Copilot

The key to getting the most out of GitHub Copilot starts with knowing how to communicate your intent clearly. Think of it like talking to a really smart coding buddy who needs the right context to help you out effectively.

## 1. Be Specific with Your Intent

Instead of writing vague comments, be explicit about what you want:

```csharp
// Bad: Create a method
// Good: Create a method that validates email addresses using regex and returns a boolean
public bool ValidateEmail(string email)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(email))
        return false;
    
    var emailRegex = new Regex(@"^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$");
    return emailRegex.IsMatch(email);
}
```

## 2. Provide Essential Context

Give Copilot the background information it needs to generate appropriate code:

```csharp
// This API endpoint handles user registration for our Philadelphia tech community platform
// It should validate the input, hash the password, and send a welcome email
[HttpPost("register")]
public async Task<IActionResult> RegisterUser([FromBody] UserRegistrationDto dto)
{
    // Copilot now knows the domain and requirements
}
```

## 3. Use Code Comments Effectively

- Start with a clear purpose statement
- Mention any specific requirements or constraints
- Include validation rules or business logic
- Reference any external dependencies or services

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too vague**: "// Do something with data"
2. **No context**: Starting to code without explaining the purpose
3. **Mixing concerns**: Asking for too many different things in one prompt
4. **Ignoring types**: Not specifying expected data types or return values

Remember, the clearer you are with your prompts, the better suggestions you'll get from Copilot. Happy coding!
