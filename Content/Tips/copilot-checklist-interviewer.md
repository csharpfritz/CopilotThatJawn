One powerful way to boost your productivity with Copilot is to ask it to generate a checklist or to interview you step-by-step for a task. Instead of just requesting information or a solution, try prompts like:

- "Give me a checklist for launching a new product."
- "Interview me to gather requirements for a client presentation."
- "Walk me through the steps to plan a successful team meeting."
- "Create a project management checklist for my team."
- "Help me plan a budget proposal by asking me questions."

## Why This Works

Copilot will respond with a structured list or a series of questions, helping you:

- **Clarify your process** - Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Avoid missing steps** - Ensure nothing falls through the cracks
- **Stay organized** - Follow a logical sequence of actions
- **Learn best practices** - Discover industry-standard approaches
- **Document your workflow** - Create reusable processes for your team

## Example in Action

**Your Prompt:** "Interview me to gather requirements for planning a company event."

**Copilot's Response:**

1. What type of event are you planning (conference, celebration, training, etc.)?
2. How many attendees are you expecting?
3. What's your budget range for this event?
4. Do you have a preferred date or timeline?
5. What are your venue requirements (location, capacity, amenities)?
6. Are there any special accommodations or accessibility needs?

## Pro Tips

- **After Copilot generates a checklist**, you can ask it to expand on any step, provide additional resources, or even help you create action items for each step
- **Use follow-up questions** like "What's the best practice for step 3?" or "Can you give me a template for step 5?"
- **Save successful checklists** as templates for future projects
- **Use your microphone and dictation** - Instead of typing long responses to Copilot's interview questions, use voice input to speak your thoughts naturally. This makes the conversation flow more like a real consultation and helps you articulate ideas quickly without getting bogged down in typing
- **Think out loud with voice** - When Copilot asks clarifying questions, use voice dictation to brainstorm and explore ideas verbally. You can refine and edit afterward, but speaking helps you capture thoughts faster than typing
- **Treat Copilot like a collaborative partner** - let it guide you, ask follow-up questions, and help you think through your work like a seasoned professional

This approach is especially useful for complex workflows, onboarding new team members, project planning, event management, or when you want to ensure best practices are followed consistently across your organization.
