One powerful way to boost your productivity with Copilot is to ask it to generate a checklist or to interview you step-by-step for a task. Instead of just requesting code or a solution, try prompts like:

- "Give me a checklist for deploying an ASP.NET app to Azure."
- "Interview me to gather requirements for a new feature."
- "Walk me through the steps to set up CI/CD for my project."
- "Create a code review checklist for my team."
- "Help me plan a database migration by asking me questions."

## Why This Works

Copilot will respond with a structured list or a series of questions, helping you:

- **Clarify your process** - Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Avoid missing steps** - Ensure nothing falls through the cracks
- **Stay organized** - Follow a logical sequence of actions
- **Learn best practices** - Discover industry-standard approaches
- **Document your workflow** - Create reusable processes for your team

## Example in Action

**Your Prompt:** "Interview me to gather requirements for building a new REST API."

**Copilot's Response:**

1. What is the primary purpose of this API?
2. Who are the intended users or consumers?
3. What data will the API work with?
4. Do you need authentication and authorization?
5. What are your performance requirements?
6. Are there any third-party integrations needed?

## Pro Tips

- **After Copilot generates a checklist**, you can ask it to expand on any step, provide code snippets, or even automate parts of the process
- **Use follow-up questions** like "What's the best practice for step 3?" or "Can you show me code for step 5?"
- **Save successful checklists** as templates for future projects
- **Use your microphone and dictation** - Instead of typing long responses to Copilot's interview questions, use voice input to speak your thoughts naturally. This makes the conversation flow more like a real consultation and helps you articulate ideas quickly without getting bogged down in typing
- **Think out loud with voice** - When Copilot asks clarifying questions, use voice dictation to brainstorm and explore ideas verbally. You can refine and edit afterward, but speaking helps you capture thoughts faster than typing
- **Treat Copilot like a collaborative partner** - let it guide you, ask follow-up questions, and help you think through your work like a seasoned tech pro

This approach is especially useful for complex workflows, onboarding new team members, code reviews, deployments, or when you want to ensure best practices are followed consistently across your projects.
