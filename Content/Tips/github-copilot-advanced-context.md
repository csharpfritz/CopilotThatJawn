# Advanced Context Techniques for GitHub Copilot

Getting the most out of GitHub Copilot often means breaking down complex tasks and providing rich context. Here's how to level up your prompt engineering game.

## 1. Break Down Complex Tasks

Don't ask Copilot to build Rome in a day. Instead, break tasks into smaller steps:

```csharp
// Step 1: Parse the JSON response from the API
var userData = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<UserResponse>(jsonString);

// Step 2: Map the response to our domain model
var user = new User
{
    Id = userData.UserId,
    Name = userData.FullName,
    Email = userData.EmailAddress
};

// Step 3: Validate the mapped data
if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(user.Email) || !IsValidEmail(user.Email))
{
    throw new ArgumentException("Invalid email address");
}
```

## 2. Provide Domain Context

Help Copilot understand your business domain:

```csharp
// This service manages tech events in the Philadelphia area
// Events can be in-person or virtual
// Each event has: title, date, location, max attendees, and tech categories
public class PhillyTechEventService
{
    // Copilot now understands the domain context
}
```

## 3. Reference Architecture Patterns

Tell Copilot about your architectural choices:

```csharp
// Using repository pattern with Entity Framework Core
// This repository handles CRUD operations for TechEvents
public class TechEventRepository : IRepository<TechEvent>
{
    // Copilot can suggest appropriate implementation
}

// Using CQRS pattern
// This handler processes the CreateTechEvent command
public class CreateTechEventHandler : ICommandHandler<CreateTechEvent>
{
    // Copilot understands the pattern and can help implement it
}
```

## 4. Include Environment Context

Let Copilot know about your infrastructure:

```csharp
// This runs in Azure Functions with Cosmos DB backend
// Processes event registrations asynchronously
// Uses Azure Service Bus for messaging
public class EventRegistrationProcessor
{
    // Copilot can suggest Azure-specific implementation details
}
```

## Advanced Tips

1. **Layer Your Context**
   - Start with high-level architecture
   - Add business domain details
   - Include technical requirements
   - Specify any constraints

2. **Use Reference Examples**
   ```csharp
   // Format dates like: "June 7, 2025 at 6:00 PM EST"
   // Numbers like: "1,234" for counts, "$19.99" for prices
   // Interface should match our other event pages
   ```

3. **Specify Performance Requirements**
   ```csharp
   // This needs to handle 1000+ concurrent users
   // Cache results for 5 minutes
   // Maximum response time: 200ms
   ```

Remember, Copilot works best when it understands both the technical and business context of your code. The more relevant context you provide, the better the suggestions you'll receive!
