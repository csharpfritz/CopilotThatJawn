## Advanced Power User Techniques

### Combining Commands

Step 1: "/draft presentation about Q4 results"
Step 2: "/add charts from Excel data"
Step 3: "/create speaker notes"
Step 4: "/design ideas for professional look"
```

### Custom Prompt Patterns
- **Context + Action + Format**: "Based on our last team meeting, create action items in bullet format"
- **Role + Task + Constraints**: "As a project manager, draft a status update under 200 words"

### Workflow Automation
```
1. Use consistent naming: "Weekly Status - [Date]"
2. Create templates: Save frequently used prompts
3. Chain commands: Link multiple Copilot actions together
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### When Copilot Doesn't Understand
- Be more specific: Instead of "make it better" â†’ "make this more professional and concise"
- Add context: "For a technical audience" or "For executives"
- Use examples: "Like this format: [provide example]"

### Getting Better Results
- **Start simple**: Basic request first, then refine
- **Iterate**: Use "refine this" or "make it more..."
- **Be patient**: Sometimes the second suggestion is the golden one

## Cross-App Integration Tips

### Document to Presentation Flow
1. Start in Word: "Draft key points for quarterly review"
2. Move to PowerPoint: "Create slides from Word document"
3. Enhance in Excel: "Generate supporting charts"
4. Share in Teams: "Create meeting summary"

### Context-Aware Commands
```
"Update all related documents with new company address"
"Create matching templates across Word, PowerPoint, and Excel"
"Generate consistent formatting across presentation materials"
```

Pro tip: Remember that Copilot understands Philly context - use it to your advantage when creating content for local audiences!
